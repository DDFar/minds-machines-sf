# Parking Planning
The Parking Planning service provides parking metadata that is collected from CityIQ's intelligent nodes installed on all street lights along public roadways or in parking lots. Each time a vehicle enters or leaves a parking space, a timestamped event is created and stored in the Predix cloud. This data can be obtained from a single sensor or a group of sensors, and can provide valuable insights about the parking activity in a given region. The data can also be used to improve traffic and parking convenience.

# Pedestrian Planning
The Pedestrian Planning service provides pedestrian metadata that is collected from CityIQ's intelligent nodes installed on all street lights along public roadways or in parking lots. As pedestrians pass by these sensors, the service creates and stores a timestamped event, counting each event. This data can be obtained from a single sensor or a group of sensors, to provide insights to city officials and local businesses about pedestrian movement in a given region. The data can also be used to enhance safety and convenience.

# Situational Awareness
The Situational Awareness service provides access to images, video, and other media collected from CityIQ's intelligent nodes installed on all street lights along public roadways. You can retrieve media on demand (streaming data) or historical media data. Examples of use cases for these images and videos include enhancing situational awareness, improving traffic flow, and verifying where vehicles are parked. The media can be requested using a date range beginning with near real-time and ending based upon data availability. This data can be obtained on-demand directly from a single sensor or node, as needed, to provide insights to city officials that enhance awareness. This service can be used in concert with other 'Intelligent Cities' services to address a variety of use cases.

# Environmental Planning
The Environmental Planning service provides environmental sensor data collected from CityIQ's intelligent nodes installed on all street lights along public roadways. This data can be obtained from a single sensor or a group of sensors, as needed, to provide timely environmental information to city officials that directly affect urban dwellers and their activities.

# Traffic Planning
The Traffic Planning service provides vehicle metadata collected from CityIQ's intelligent nodes installed on all street lights along public roadways. As vehicles pass by these sensors, information such as speed, direction, lane use, and volume (counts) are collected and stored with a time-stamp in the Predix cloud. The data can be viewed from any number of nodes in a given region and can present both historical and near real-time information. The density, range, and flexibility of this sensor data can provide insights into traffic patterns at different intervals. Along with facilitating the planning for future safety and convenience enhancements, the data can reveal opportunities to optimize traffic flows.
