## Overview
The hackathon challenge and all logistics can be found here: https://mmsf17.devpost.com/

Completed projects are due at **4pm Wednesday October 25th** and must be submitted here: https://mmsf17.devpost.com/submissions

This requires you create a devpost account in order to be eligible for a prize. Please make sure you have consulted the requirements that are specific to each challenge / dataset.

Your team can also take up a **Developer Kit** complementary challenge using a Predix Developer Kit to improve your solution with a connectivity feature.

## Ecomagination Challenge

*Data Presented by EURELECTRIC, EHPA, ESB and Fraunhofer*

Electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy, and electric building heating can drive decarbonization and economic value.  The grid needs to keep up!  Innovate solutions for electrification, and evaluate decarbonization impact. This challenge deals with: Renewable energy resource siting; electric heating & conversion to heat pumps analysis; EV charger siting; renewable energy integration.

2 datasets are provided for this:


- **Grid Timeseries Dataset** Load forecasting & temperature correction on distribution circuits
- **Heatpump Timeseries Dataset** Electric heating & conversion to heat pumps

You can find detailed information about each dataset inside its dedicated folder.


## Developer Kit

*Presented by Intel*

Your mission is to address one of the problems related to sustainability. To boost your project prototype you can add connected hardware with Predix Edge to your solution. 

You can find detailed information in the "Intel Dev Kit" folder in this repo.
