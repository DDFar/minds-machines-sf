# Minds and Machines Appathon 2017

## Overview
The hackathon challenge and all logistics can be found [here on devpost](https://mmsf17.devpost.com/).

Completed projects are due at **4pm Wednesday October 25th** and must be submitted [here on devpost](https://mmsf17.devpost.com/submissions).

This requires you create a devpost account in order to be eligible for a prize. Please make sure you have consulted the requirements that are specific to each challenge / dataset.

Your team can also take up a **Developer Kit** complementary challenge using a Predix Developer Kit to improve your solution with a connectivity feature.

## Challenge
Decarbonization, Decentralization, and Digitization are driving transformation across the global energy sector.  Today, more renewable energy sources are installed on a yearly basis than all other forms of energy generation combined.  At the same time, distributed energy resources like rooftop solar are driving a backwards flow of electricity in distribution systems.

Digital tools applied to existing power plants are already driving efficiencies that reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, while increasing output.  Your challenge: **Develop new solutions on GEâ€™s Predix platform to drive the future of energy, reduce emissions, and improve air quality for all.**

Example solutions include renewable energy generation siting, electric vehicle charger siting, renewable energy integration, asset performance management and field services management, electricity distribution optimization, measuring air quality to provide transparency to drive emissions reductions, maximizing efficiency and output of energy generation systems to do more with less fuel.

## How do I get started?
Before starting the challenges, you will need to have a working Predix space on the cloud to deploy your services and apps to.

The [How To Setup Your Predix Space](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/blob/master/How%20To%20Setup%20Your%20Predix%20Space.md) guide will walk you through a script to quickly setup your space.

We provided an example Time Series seed app to show how you can request and plot time series data. The seed app uses Heatpump data from the Electrification Challenge and can be run by following the [Timeseries Seed App](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Seed%20Apps/timeseries_seed_app) guide.

## What's in this Repository?

This repository contains a number of resources that may help you get started, including sample data, APIs linking to more sample data, and seed apps. You are **not** required to use any of these, but may find them to be useful.

### [Electrification Challenge Sample Data](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Electrification%20Challenge)
*Data Presented by EURELECTRIC, EHPA, ESB and Fraunhofer*

This resource contains sample datasets for you to use.

Electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy, and electric building heating can drive decarbonization and economic value.  The grid needs to keep up!  Innovate solutions for electrification, and evaluate decarbonization impact. This challenge deals with: Renewable energy resource siting; electric heating & conversion to heat pumps analysis; EV charger siting; renewable energy integration. 

#### Two Datasets
There are two real datasets in separate folders for your use.
- The [Grid Timeseries Dataset](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Electrification%20Challenge/Grid%20Timeseries%20Dataset) for load forecasting & temperature correction on distribution circuits
- The [Heatpump Timeseries Dataset](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Electrification%20Challenge/Heatpump%20Timeseries%20Dataset) for electric heating & conversion to heat pumps

You can find detailed information about each dataset inside its dedicated folder under [Electrification Challenge](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Electrification%20Challenge)

### [Current by GE, CityIQ APIs](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/CityIQ)

This folder contains information and postman collections to access the [CityIQ APIs](https://developer.currentbyge.com/cityiq).

You can find detailed information about each dataset inside its dedicated folder under "CityIQ"

### [Intel Dev Kit](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Intel%20Dev%20Kit)

*Presented by Intel*

Your mission is to address one of the problems related to sustainability. To boost your project prototype you can add connected hardware with Predix Edge to your solution.

You can find detailed information in the [Intel Dev Kit](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Intel%20Dev%20Kit) folder in this repo.

### [Seed Apps](https://github.com/PredixDev/minds-machines-sf/tree/master/Seed%20Apps)
This folder contains a starter application preconfigured to access the challenge data.
